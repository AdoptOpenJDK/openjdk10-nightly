# Nightly Builds

This repository was used for publishing all of the nightly builds from the AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK build community.

These binaries are built on a shared CI infrastructure (see https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net) using an openly shared build tool chain (see https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build)

## WARNING: LATEST BINARIES ARE SOURCED FROM A DIFFERENT REPO
